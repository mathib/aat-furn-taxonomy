<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The AAT-FURN taxonomy contains OWL classes to classify **furniture components**.
The taxonomy concepts are extracted and restructured from the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus ([Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html)), v2020-07-29.
Other taxonomies might define classification concepts for architectural and building system components.
The main taxonomy is structured using RDFS subsumption axioms. 
Beside the main tree structure of classes, an alternative method to navigate the taxonomy is provided based on [gvp:GuideTerm](http://vocab.getty.edu/ontology#GuideTerm) instances connected to the taxonomy classes using [contax:containsGuideTerm](https://w3id.org/con-tax#containsGuideTerm) and [contax:containsConcept](https://w3id.org/con-tax#containsConcept) properties.
